#Documentation for skype

You will have to add skype to the channels in the config.json file.
This channel will take two inputs, cid ~ Skype bot's id, cs ~ Skype bot's secret.

To use complex responses(buttons, cards, videos), the user will have to import class SkypeBot from __skype__ folder.
For further understanding of the methods of sending and receiving the message, read the readme in the __skype__ folder.

Example of a simple text message:
SkypeBotInstance.setData(usersMessage)
SkypeBotInstance.sendTextMessage("Some text message", userMessage)

Example of a complex message:
SkypeBotInstance.setData(usersMessage) // Only if you want to avoid giving the userMessage/Payload again
msg = SkypeBotInstance.createMessage()
SkypeBotInstance.addImage(msg, "http://i.imgur.com/CfSwf.jpg")
SkypeBotInstance.sendMessage(msg) (or) SkypeBotInstance.sendMessage(msg, usersMessage)
